**An introductory guide to building cross-platform mobile applications with Flutter 2.5 and Dart**

## What is this book about?
There have been many attempts at creating frameworks that are truly cross-platform, but most struggle to create a native-like experience at high performance levels. Flutter achieves this with an elegant design and a wealth of third-party plugins, making it the future of mobile app development. If you are a mobile developer who wants to create rich and expressive native apps with the latest Google Flutter framework, this book is for you.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Explore the core concepts of the Flutter framework and how it is used for cross-platform development
* Understand the fundamentals of the Dart programming language
* Work with Flutter widgets and learn the concepts of stateful and stateless widgets
* Add animation to your app using animated widgets and advanced animations techniques
* Master the complete development lifecycle, including testing and debugging
